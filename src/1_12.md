##Store passwords (debian based solution)

It can be (really) annoying to re-enter your password everytime you want to push a commit with git (or use another application using passwords). Luckily, there is a solution for this.

###Install libgnome-keyring-dev

```bash
sudo apt-get install libgnome-keyring-dev
sudo make --directory=/usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring
```

Now let's setup the credential:

```
git config --global credential.helper /usr/share/doc/git/contrib/credential/gnome-keyring/git-credential-gnome-keyring
```

You should be all set now!
