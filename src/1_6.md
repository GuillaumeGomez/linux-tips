#Linux tips
##Get syslog when your linux installation fails

Sometimes, while modifying a linux installer, you might break it (it happened to the best of us) and get a wonderful red screen:

Problematic isn't it? Let's try to get the installation logs! To do so, I'll show two ways of doing it.

###Access to console

Once you get the red screen, you have to possibility to access another console (on mine, I have two). You can access it with the keys ALT+F2 (and F3 for the second console for me):

From there, you'll have a minimal shell which is more than enough for what we need. The logs *should* be located in `/var/log/syslog`. You should at least have an access to `nano` text editor (once again, it's minimal but should be enough) if you want to explore your log file (`less` and `vim` weren't available for me).

If you want to take a look to what the installer installed, you need to go into the `/target` folder. Also, if you want a bit more "control" or a better shell. You can do it like this:

```Shell
> chroot /target
> bash
```

And here you go!

###Using a live-cd

Any live-cd would do the trick, but I like PartedMagic, so let's go for it. I use this [version](https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/blog/pmagic_2012_10_10_x86_64.iso) of it (if you're too lazy to search :p). An old one, but it works fine.

First thing to do (if needed), change the keyboard layout:

Once you find the good one, just press "Ok"/"Yes" buttons until it stops asking.

Time to get into our system! To see what available partitions you have, run the `lvscan` command into a console. Then just mount it and find the log file. So for example, in my case I'll do:

```Shell
> mkdir /tmp/t # any other name would be fine
> mount /dev/vg00/lvroot /tmp/t
> cd /tmp/t
> less var/log/syslog
```

You can also check around what your installer installed and stuff. PartedMagic live-cd also provides useful tools to work on system things (partitions for example). Don't hesitate to take a look to what it offers!
