##Mounting a File System of a remote computer

It can always be useful to be able to mount a File System from another computer. In here, we'll use `sshfs` to do it (other softwares like `ftpfs` exist).

###Preparing the field

First, you need to be able to connect on the remote computer with the `ssh` command:

```Shell
> ssh user@some_computer
# if it doesn't work, try with the port 2242 like this:
> ssh user@some_computer -p 2242
```

If everything worked fine, we can move forward.

###Mounting the File System

In general, it's preferable to mount the remote directory inside the `/tmp` directory. So first:

```Shell
mkdir /tmp/remote
```

Ok, now we just have to mount it:

```Shell
sshfs -o user@some_computer:/the/remote/folder /tmp/remote/
```

And that's all! However, it's possible you might encounter rights issue. For this, we'll need to add more options. First, you'll need to get your remote folder user id and group id:

```Shell
> ssh user@some_computer
> ls -l /the/remote/folder
drwxr-xr-x  3 imperio imperioland 4096 Dec 23 11:33 /the/remote/folder
> ls -ln /the/remote/folder
drwxr-xr-x  3 1000 1000 4096 Dec 23 11:33 /the/remote/folder
```

Create two files on your computer (not the remote one!) like this:

```Shell
echo imperio:1000 > uidmap
echo imperioland:1000 > gidmap
```

Don't forget to enter your information and not mine! Then, we can retry to use `sshfs`:

```Shell
sshfs -o allow_other,idmap=file,uidfile=`pwd`/uidmap,gidfile=`pwd`/gidmap,nomap=ignore user@some_computer:/the/remote/folder /tmp/remote
```

Here you go!
