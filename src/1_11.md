##Setting up an IRC bouncer

In here, I'll explain how to install an IRC bouncer (`znc` to be precise). Let's go!

###Getting pieces

First, install `znc` (I'll use `apt` in this tutorial):

```bash
# try this line first:
sudo apt-get install znc znc-extra
# if you have an error about znc-extra, then try this one:
sudo apt-get install znc
```

If everything in here went fine, then great!

###Setting up

Now that you have `znc`, you need to configure it. To make things easier, I'll comment each step:

```bash
> znc --makeconf
[ .. ] Checking for list of available modules...
[ >> ] ok
[ ** ] Building new config
[ ** ]
[ ** ] First let's start with some global settings...
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] What port would you like ZNC to listen on? (1025 to 65535): 3333
```

In here, you need to pick a port on which your bouncer will listen (it doesn't have to match the irc servers you want to connect to). I chose `3333`.

```bash
[ ?? ] Would you like ZNC to listen using SSL? (yes/no) [no]: yes
```

For security reasons, I enabled `SSL`.

```bash
[ ?? ] Would you like ZNC to listen using both IPv4 and IPv6? (yes/no) [yes]:
```

Doesn't matter so I used `yes`.

```bash
[ .. ] Verifying the listener...
[ >> ] ok
[ ** ]
[ ** ] -- Global Modules --
[ ** ]
[ ** ] +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] | Name      | Description                                              |
[ ** ] +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] | partyline | Internal channels and queries for users connected to znc |
[ ** ] | webadmin  | Web based administration module                          |
[ ** ] +-----------+----------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] And 13 other (uncommon) modules. You can enable those later.
[ ** ]
```

This part is about the modules. I'll let you choose yourself and just put what I chose.

```bash
[ ?? ] Load global module <partyline>? (yes/no) [no]: yes
[ ?? ] Load global module <webadmin>? (yes/no) [no]:
[ ** ]
```

The interesting part is now starting. You need to setup the user that'll be used to connect to your bouncer:

```bash
[ ** ] Now we need to set up a user...
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] Username (AlphaNumeric): imperio
[ ?? ] Enter Password:
[ ?? ] Confirm Password:
[ ?? ] Would you like this user to be an admin? (yes/no) [yes]:
[ ?? ] Nick [imperio]:
[ ?? ] Alt Nick [imperio_]:
[ ?? ] Ident [imperio]:
[ ?? ] Real Name [Got ZNC?]:
```

So until this point, just basic information. Try to not mess with them! The following options aren't *that* useful so you can keep default values, it won't have much impact...

```bash
[ ?? ] Bind Host (optional):
[ ?? ] Number of lines to buffer per channel [50]: 1000
[ ?? ] Would you like to clear channel buffers after replay? (yes/no) [yes]: no
[ ?? ] Default channel modes [+stn]:
[ ** ]
```

We're now back in the modules, but on the user's side now:

```bash
[ ** ] -- User Modules --
[ ** ]
[ ** ] +--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] | Name         | Description                                                                              |
[ ** ] +--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] | chansaver    | Keep config up-to-date when user joins/parts                                             |
[ ** ] | controlpanel | Dynamic configuration through IRC. Allows editing only yourself if you're not ZNC admin. |
[ ** ] | perform      | Keeps a list of commands to be executed when ZNC connects to IRC.                        |
[ ** ] | webadmin     | Web based administration module                                                          |
[ ** ] +--------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] And 21 other (uncommon) modules. You can enable those later.
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] Load module <chansaver>? (yes/no) [no]: yes
[ ?? ] Load module <controlpanel>? (yes/no) [no]:
[ ?? ] Load module <perform>? (yes/no) [no]: yes
[ ?? ] Load module <webadmin>? (yes/no) [no]:
[ ** ]
```

The next part is very important. You'll now fulfill the IRC server(s) on which you want your bouncer to connect to. Do it very carefully!

```bash
[ ?? ] Would you like to set up a network? (yes/no) [no]: yes
```

So obviously you answered `yes`. Now the next thing is simple: if you want to connect to `freenode`, put `freenode`, otherwise put `efnet`.

```bash
[ ?? ] Network (e.g. `freenode' or `efnet'): efnet
[ ** ]
```

Other modules, but for network this time.

```bash
[ ** ] -- Network Modules --
[ ** ]
[ ** ] +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] | Name        | Description                                                                                     |
[ ** ] +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] | chansaver   | Keep config up-to-date when user joins/parts                                                    |
[ ** ] | keepnick    | Keep trying for your primary nick                                                               |
[ ** ] | kickrejoin  | Autorejoin on kick                                                                              |
[ ** ] | nickserv    | Auths you with NickServ                                                                         |
[ ** ] | perform     | Keeps a list of commands to be executed when ZNC connects to IRC.                               |
[ ** ] | simple_away | This module will automatically set you away on IRC while you are disconnected from the bouncer. |
[ ** ] +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
[ ** ] And 20 other (uncommon) modules. You can enable those later.

We're now going into the interesting stuff: setting up the IRC servers we want to connect to:

```bash
[ ** ] -- IRC Servers --
[ ** ] Only add servers from the same IRC network.
[ ** ] If a server from the list can't be reached, another server will be used.
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] IRC server (host only): irc.mozilla.org
[ ?? ] [irc.mozilla.org] Port (1 to 65535) [6667]:
[ ?? ] [irc.mozilla.org] Password (probably empty):
[ ?? ] Does this server use SSL? (yes/no) [no]:
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] Would you like to add another server for this IRC network? (yes/no) [no]:
[ ** ]
[ ** ] -- Channels --
[ ** ]
[ ?? ] Would you like to add a channel for ZNC to automatically join? (yes/no) [yes]: #rust-docs

[ >> ] ok
[ ** ]
[ ** ]To connect to this ZNC you need to connect to it as your IRC server
[ ** ]using the port that you supplied.  You have to supply your login info
[ ** ]as the IRC server password like this: user/network:pass.
[ ** ]

[ ** ]/server <znc_server_ip> +3333 imperio:<pass>
[ ** ]And this in your browser...
[ ** ]https://<znc_server_ip>:3333/
[ ** ]

[ ** ] ZNC 1.4 - http://znc.in
```

And that's mostly all.

###Connecting to the bouncer

To connect to you bouncer, you'll need to do a few things in your IRC client:

* Enable SSL.
* Accept invalid SSL certificate.
* Set server password.

For the last point, it has to follow a precise format. So in my case, my bouncer user is `imperio`, I chose the `efnet` network (since I'm not connecting to freenode) and then I chose `poney` as password. So my server password will have to be:

```
imperio/efnet:poney
```

Simple!

###Accessing to the bouncer from outside

If your bouncer has been set in a local network, I guess you want to make it accessible from outside? The only way to do it is to open a port from your internet box provider. I'll let you look into it.

###znc commands

A few commands from znc can be useful like:

* `znc --makepass`: to reset the bouncer user password.
* `znc --makeconf`: to generate a config file (or overwrite it) interactively.

It's important to note that the configuration of your znc bouncer is generally located into `~/.znc/configs/znc.conf`. Try to not mess this file!
