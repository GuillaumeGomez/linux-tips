##Having remote graphic applications with ssh

After failing to setup correctly openserver to get graphic access from another computer, I discovered the *X* option of ssh. All you need to do is to run a ssh server on the computer you want to connect on and that's good! You also have to allow the X11 forwarding on both server and client sides.

###Client side

Go to the *~/.ssh/config* file and set `ForwardX11` parameter to `yes` like this:

```Shell
# some other parameters...

ForwardX11 yes

# ...
```

###Server side

Go to the */etc/ssh/sshd_config* file and set `ForwardX11` parameter to `yes` like this:

```Shell
# some other parameters...

ForwardX11 yes

# ...
```

You also need to have `xauth` installed (but it's very uncommon to not have it).

And finally, you have to restart ssh service. In case you forgot how to do so:

```Shell
> sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
# or:
> sudo service ssh restart
# on systemd:
> systemctl restart ssh
```

Then you can connect to the remote computer like this:

```Shell
> ssh login@ip -X
```

For now, nothing different should have happened. But if you start a graphic application, it'll start directly on your computer.
