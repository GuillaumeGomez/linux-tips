#Linux tips
##Modify files of your linux without booting on it

If you broke your linux and need to undo a change, you can do it by either using a bootable key and change the file through it like showed in [here](https://blog.guillaume-gomez.fr/Linux-tips/1/6#Using%20a%20live-cd) or avoid running `/sbin/init`. You wonder why? Then read what follows!

###Change boot line in grub

The first thing to do is to edit the boot line of your distribution when you're on the grub. Generally, it's the key 'e' but it might change, depending on your system. Then go to the line starting by "linux".

In this line, add at the end (with a whitespace before):

```shell
init=/bin/sh
```

(Or another shell, like `bash` if you know its binary path.)

Or even more simple:

```shell
break
```

Then press the button to boot (in my case, this is `CTRL-X` or `F10`). Once done, you should be on a command line. Congrats, we have prevent the `init` program to run!

###Change files

We can now explore our root partition but not modify files. If you want to modify files, you'll have to remount the root partition with write rights:

```shell
mount -o remount,rw /
```

We can now edit files as we want. If you want to mount other partitions, run (but you'll need a write access):

```shell
vgchange -ay
```

Then check the format of the partition you want to mount with:

```shell
blkid
```

So it'll display in my case:

```shell
> blkid
/dev/sda1: PARTUUID="c3554sd-sdfdsq-a454-01154875qs"
/dev/mapper/vg00-lvroot: UUID="05547454-c54d-4999-bfbf-cc54557574" TYPE="ext3"
/dev/mapper/vg00-lvopt: UUID="5af4d5ee-aaa4-9ef6-e254-dde475s47d" TYPE="ext3"
/dev/mapper/vg00-lvvar: UUID="4599fab2-a4b7-f65e-5d4e-c47d6654ec" TYPE="ext4"
/dev/mapper/vg00-lvsub: UUID="19fab277-47b1-5dfe-4235-d66dfe54ec" TYPE="ext4"
```

And then mount them:

```shell
mount -t [format] /dev/vg00/[partition] /[where]
```

So in my case (`sub` is a child of `var`):

```shell
mkdir /mnt
mount -t ext3 /dev/vg00/lvroot /mnt
mount -t ext3 /dev/vg00/lvopt /mnt/opt
mount -t ext4 /dev/vg00/lvopt /mnt/var
mount -t ext4 /dev/vg00/lvopt /mnt/var/sub
```

Now you have everything you want in `/mnt`. Then you `chroot` in it to make your life a bit easier:

```shell
chroot /mnt
```
