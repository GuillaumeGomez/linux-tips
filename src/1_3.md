##Setup a bridge connection with a linux VM

This was tested on VirtualBox and VMWare, I can't confirm for other VMs.

First, go to your targetted VM into "network settings". Create two interfaces (one host-only, one Bride adapter). Once this is done, open a terminal and write:

```Shell
> sudo route del default
> sudo dhclient eth1
```

Then try to ping your host from your VM (and vice-versa) to check if everything went correctly.
