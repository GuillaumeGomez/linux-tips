#Linux tips
##Setup a bridge connection with a linux VM

This was tested on VirtualBox and VMWare, I can't confirm for other VMs.

First, go to your targetted VM into "network settings". Create two interfaces (one host-only and one Bridge adapter) or just one (the Bridge adapter one seems to be the easier one). Once this is done, open a terminal and write:

```Shell
> sudo route del default
> sudo dhclient eth1
```

Then try to ping your host from your VM (and vice-versa) to check if everything went correctly.

###Reminder

To get your ip (of the VM or of your computer): just `ifconfig`.
